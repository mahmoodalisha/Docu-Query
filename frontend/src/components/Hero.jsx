        <ul>
          <li><strong>Q: Can the bot handle multiple PDFs at once?</strong> A: Currently, you can upload one PDF at a time, but feel free to ask as many questions as you need from that document.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: What kind of PDFs work best?</strong> A: Text-based PDFs (e.g., eBooks, research papers) are ideal. Scanned documents might not work as well unless they contain clear text.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: Is my data secure?</strong> A: Yes! We prioritize your privacy. Your uploaded PDFs are only processed by the bot and are not shared or stored after your session ends.</li>
        </ul>
